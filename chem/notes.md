# Reactions

**Decomposition Reactions**

More complex molecules breakdown to simpler products.

**Synthesis Reactions**

Reaction where simpler reactants combine to form more complex
products/molecules.

**Single Replacement Reactions**

Reactions that involve the movement of electrons. Metals and non-metals combine
to form products.

**Double Replacement Reactions**

Everyone switches partners (as opposed to **single** replacement reactions).
Also known by what happens as a result of the reaction (e.g. precipitation
reactions precipitates are being created).

Some of these reactions create gases (there are rules to figure out which ones
do or do not).

Nuetralization is when you take an acid and react it with a base to create water
and salt (another type of double replacement reaction).

**Combustion Reactions**

Hydrocarbon + Oxygen -> Carbon Dioxide + Water

Without enough oxygen, you get an inefficient reaction that results in ash and
Carbon Monoxide. For this class, we pretend all reactions are 100% efficient.
