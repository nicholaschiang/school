**Goal**
Test whether the people in our Stat class can tell the difference between
bottled water and tap water.

**Purpose**
What is the purpose of completing this experiment?
- Bottled water costs ~300x more than tap water.
- Nestle bottles and sells water from drought-ridden states (e.g. CA).
- Tap and bottled water have the same amount of safety.

**Materials**
- 30 people
- 60 mugs
- Enough water

**Procedure**
1. Fill each person's two mugs with 1 of the 3 combinations (tap +
   bottled, bottled + bottled, tap + tap).
2. Do that again for all three trials.
3. Have them tell you which trial had a difference (between the water in the 2 
   mugs).
4. Record results.
5. Check what percent were right every time. 28 people have to get it right (to 
   reach our 93% threshold).
