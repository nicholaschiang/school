**American Classics H Discussion Guidelines**
- Respectfully disagree. Always make an effort to disagree with the idea, not
  the person to share the idea. Disagree with ideas, not classmates.
- Everyone participating.
- No side conversations or other distracting things.
- Timeline on how long discussions should be. Don't waste time. Make an effort
  to distill thoughts into 30-40 seconds. Avoid 1-2 min monologues (no
  thinking aloud during discussions).
- Stay on topic. Don't go off on a tangent.
- Raise hands so people don't talk over each others.
- Quality over quantity. Grades should be based on the quality of one's ideas,
  not the amount they talk.\
- Take risks. Don't let silence rule... Answer the question even if you might be
  wrong (especially seeing as this is an honors class).
- Try to call on people who haven't talked.
- Do the assigned reading! Be as prepared as you can be.
- Enthusiasm!
- Active listening! Build off of each other's comments. Use each other's names
  during the discussion (e.g. "I would like to build off of what Isis said 
  and..."). Organically transition to next logical topic of conversation when 
  existing topic has been exhausted.
- When appropriate, use techniques like "the devil's advocate" to enrich the
  discussion.
